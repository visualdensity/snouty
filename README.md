Project Snouty
==============

This is a base Symfony project stub for quick start of new Symfony based projects.
To start, clone the repository and in the cloned repo, simply run:

    ./setup.sh

Or if you need to run it manually, do the following, in order:

  1. Copy `app/config/parameters.yml-dist` to `app/config/parameters.yml`
  2. In the root folder, run `php ./composer.phar install`

After installing all the required packages, you should be able to run the following:

    php app/console 

And you should see a list of available commands. 


Have fun!
